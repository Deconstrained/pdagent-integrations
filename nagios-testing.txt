# Nagios Testing

This document shows you how to test the Nagios integration using the public
Nagios Integration Guide.

1. Configure Nagios using the public Nagios Integration Guide:
    http://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/nagios-integration-guide-2/

     > For development builds of `pdagent-integrations` package, see
     > `build-linux/howto.txt` for install instructions.

2. The simplest way to test that your Nagios integration is working as
    expected (assuming that you are running the SSH check), is to disable
    the system ssh service.  This will not disconnect any existing ssh sessions.

    `sudo service ssh stop`

    You can then force the check in Nagios in
    Services > SSH > Re-schedule the next check of this service.  By default, a Nagios
    service must fail 5 checks before it will send a notification.

    Be sure to restart the ssh service when you have verified your test.

    `sudo service ssh start`

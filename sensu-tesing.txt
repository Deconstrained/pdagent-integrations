# Sensu Testing

This document shows you how to test the Sensu integration using the public
Sensu Integration Guide.

1. Configure Sensu using the public Sensu Integration Guide:
    http://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/sensu-integration-guide/

     > For development builds of `pdagent-integrations` package, see
     > `build-linux/howto.txt` for install instructions.
    
2. The easiest way to test that your Sensu integration is working as
    expected is to write a brief script that prints out a message and exits
    with status 0 or 1, and then add the script as a check for the
    Sensu client to run.
    
    For instance, the script could look like this:

    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    EXITCODE=0
    if [ $EXITCODE -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Server down"
    else
        echo "Server up"
    fi
    exit $EXITCODE
    ```

    Save the script as `/etc/sensu/plugins/dummyhostcheck.sh` on the system
    that runs the Sensu client, and make sure it is executable by running 
    `chmod 755 /etc/sensu/plugins/dummyhostcheck.sh`.


3. Add a check to the configuration on the system that runs the Sensu server
    and specify "pagerduty" as the handler:
    ```
    {
        "checks": {
            "host": {
                "command": "/etc/sensu/plugins/dummyhostcheck.sh",
                "subscribers": [
                    "dummy"
                ],
                "interval": 10,
                "standalone": false,
                "handler": "pagerduty"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

4. Add the "dummy" subscription to the client configuration, i.e. 
    ```
    {    
        "client": {
    ...
            "subscriptions": [
                ...,"dummy"
            ],
    ...
    }
    ```

5. You can then trigger an event by setting `EXITCODE=1` in the above
    script; it will run the script every ten seconds and send an event
    to PagerDuty with the script's output if the script exits with
    nonzero status.

For sample client and server configurations, see the Sensu installation
guide:

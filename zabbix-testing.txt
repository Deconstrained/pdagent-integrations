# Zabbix Testing

This document shows you how to test the Zabbix integration using the public
Zabbix Integration Guide.

1. Configure Zabbix using the public Zabbix Integration Guide:
    http://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/zabbix-integration-guide-2/

     > For development builds of `pdagent-integrations` package, see
     > `build-linux/howto.txt` for install instructions.

2. Under Configuration > Hosts, enable the "Zabbix server" host. (Click on "Not
Monitored" under Status)

3. Reboot the Zabbix VM (`sudo reboot` in the VM). This should trigger an alert.

    > Note: the VM needs to be up for at least 10 mins after you enable checks
    > since the Zabbix host restart check runs only once every 10 mins.
